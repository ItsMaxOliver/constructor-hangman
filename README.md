# constructor-hangman

This is an application that allows you to play hangman within your terminal. Once you've cloned the repo make sure you type <b>npm install</b> before you try to play. 
  
  Type <b>node index</b> into your terminal to begin playing.

The limit for wrong guesses is 7. The word or phrase is randomly chosen by reading a file with predefined word choices. 

The user is shown the blanks for the word or phrase that they are trying to guess and then prompted to enter a letter.

Once the word has been guessed a new word will be generated. If the user runs out of guesses, the game is over.

--You can always exit the game by typing ctrl-c into your terminal.--
